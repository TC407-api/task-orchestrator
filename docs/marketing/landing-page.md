## Why AI Agent Projects Fail

Most AI agents work in a sandbox but crumble in production.

- **The Reliability Gap:** One API timeout or hallucination cascades into a total system failure.
- **The Cost Black Hole:** Recursive loops and unoptimized prompts drain budgets in hours.
- **The "Black Box" Problem:** No visibility into why an agent failed or how to prevent it next time.
- **Manual Orchestration:** Developers spend 80% of their time writing "glue code" instead of building features.

## The Solution: Task-Orchestrator

Task-Orchestrator is the first MCP-native platform designed specifically for production Claude workflows. We don't just run agents; we provide the **infrastructure** that keeps them alive.

### 6 Pillars of Production Reliability

1. **Self-Healing Infrastructure:** Built-in circuit breakers and exponential backoff ensure one failure doesn't kill the process.
2. **Agent Immune System:** Automatically detects failure patterns and adapts agent behavior in real-time.
3. **44 Production-Ready MCP Tools:** A massive library of pre-built tools for immediate deployment.
4. **Granular Cost Management:** Set hard budget limits at the project, agent, or task level.
5. **Cross-Project Federation:** Share learned patterns and successful strategies across your entire organization.
6. **Specialized Archetypes:** Deploy pre-configured Architect, Builder, QC, and Researcher agents out of the box.
